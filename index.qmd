::: {#hero-heading}

Hi! I am Jishen Du. Currently, I am currently a 5-th year Ph.D. student in Mathematics at <a href="https://math.rutgers.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rutgers University</a>. My advisor is Prof. <a href="https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~yzhuang/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yi-Zhi Huang</a>.

I'm interested in **vertex operator algebras and their representation theory**, as the underlying algebraic/categorical structure of **two-dimensional conformal field theory**. In particular, I am interested in the construction of tensor-categorical structure in module categories of vertex operator algebras. I am also interested in topics that are related to this area. For more detail, please see my research statement (<a href="Research description.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full version</a>, <a href="Research description (abridged).pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">abridged version</a>).

My current work is on orbifold theory. More specifically, I am constructing the ''$G$-twisted vertex/braided tensor category'' structure on the categories of modules of vertex operator algebras.
